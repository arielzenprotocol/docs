The Cost Model
--------------

Central to the analysis of contracts cost is the notion of a *cost model*.

A *cost model* for a language assigns a natural number to each closed term in the language in
such a way that the term should take **at most** this number of "abstract steps" to evaluate,
this natural number is called *the cost* of that term (relative to that cost model).

The abstract steps could be, for example, beta-reductions, so if the cost of a term :fsharp:`M`
is :fsharp:`n` it would take at most :fsharp:`n` beta-reductions to reduce :fsharp:`M` to a
normal form with the chosen evaluation strategy of the language.

The cost is defined **recursively** on the structure of the term, and it could depend on
the **values** of some of its subterms, so we can think of the cost as a term in the language
which **evalutes** to a natural number.

We use the notation :math:`c\left(M\right)` for the cost of the term :fsharp:`M`.

In practice the actual cost (relative to the cost model) is **not computed directly**,
instead - the cost is divided into 2 components:

  1. **Compositional Cost** - which is **declared** by the **developer** and
     **verified** by the **type system**
  2. **Syntactic Cost** - which is **computed** by the **elaborator**

In fact - given general recursion it is **impossible** to automatically compute the cost
of any arbitrary term in the language.

Another deviation from the cost model is that the cost we give in practice is
an **upper bound** on the cost given by the cost model, because it is easier to compute,
but since the cost model itself is an upper bound on the number of steps the approximation
we use in practice still gives a valid upper bound.

The **syntactic cost** is given to terms **by virtue of their form**, and acts as a **seed** which
the **compositional cost** later **propogates** into the program through the **type system**.


The Cost Type
-------------

Given a cost model we define a special type constructor :fsharp:`cost` to indicate that
a term of type :fsharp:`cost m A`, where :fsharp:`m` is a natural number and :fsharp:`A` is a
type, would take at most :fsharp:`m` steps to produce a **value** of type :fsharp:`A`.

Dually - we use the type :fsharp:`cost m A` to indicate that a term of this type **represents
a value** of type :fsharp:`A` which **has taken** at most :fsharp:`m` steps to evaluate.

When a **term** :fsharp:`M` has the type :fsharp:`cost m A` we say that :fsharp:`M` is a
*costed term*, with a *cost* of :fsharp:`m`.

When a **function** :fsharp:`f` has the type :fsharp:`A -> cost m B` we say that
:fsharp:`f` is a *costed function*, with a *cost* of :fsharp:`m`, which means that when
given an input of type :fsharp:`A` it takes :fsharp:`f` at most :fsharp:`m` steps to produce
an output of type :fsharp:`B`.


Compositional Cost
------------------

The :fsharp:`cost` type constructor behaves as a an **indexed monad**, indexed over the
additive monoid of the natural numbers, so whenever you compose (using Kleisli composition)
2 costed functions :fsharp:`f : B -> cost n C` and :fsharp:`g : A -> cost m B`
you get a function of type :fsharp:`A -> cost (m + n) C` where the cost is the sum of the costs
of :fsharp:`f` and :fsharp:`g`.

In practice - the :fsharp:`cost` monad in *ZF\** is implemented as **the identity monad**,
where the index could be set arbitrarily, so as far as *ZF\** is concerned - **it is up to
the developer to honestly declare the costs of terms**.

**The validity of the cost of a term is not fully enforced by the compiler!**

The compiler only makes sure that the costs are **composed correctly**.

To enforce the validity of the costs we combine the compiler with an **elaborator**,
which would be explained in detail later on.

To lift a term into the monad we use the :fsharp:`ret` function, which is the unit of the
monad and has the type :fsharp:`ret : a -> cost 0 a`.
Since the :fsharp:`ret` function gives a term a cost of :fsharp:`0`, we use the function
:fsharp:`inc : (m:nat) -> cost n a -> cost (n+m) a` to increase the declared cost of a term.

Syntactic Cost
--------------

The cost monad can only ensure that costs are composed correctly, but it cannot
enforce the declared costs to conform to the cost model - it completely trusts
the developer to declare costs honestly.

In order to actually **enforce** the cost model, we use a device called *the elaborator*.

The elaborator scans the syntax trees of the terms and recursively sums up the cost of
each branch, adding additional constant cost with each clause and primitive operation.

Eventually, when the elaborator reaches either a **lambda expression**,
or a **let expression** (which could be a **top-level let**) - it embeds the accumulated cost of the body of the expression
into the body, by replacing it with an application of the :fsharp:`inc` function, along
with the accumulated cost, on the body; this ensures 2 things:

    1. That the term returns an output which is wrapped in the :fsharp:`cost` monad.
    2. That all the syntactic cost is accounted for.

Examples
--------

Let's create a simple function which takes a function and an argument and applies the function on the argument:

.. code-block:: fsharp

    val applyOnce (#a #b:Type): (a -> b) -> a -> b
    let applyOnce #_ #_ f x = f x

Elaborating the function will yield the following:

.. code-block:: fsharp

    val applyOnce: #a: Type -> #b: Type -> (a -> b) -> a -> b
    let applyOnce #_ #_ f x = inc 1 (f x)

That's because function application (:fsharp:`f x`) has a cost of 1, which is embedded into the let-expression with :fsharp:`inc`.

However - trying to compile this function will result in a typing error - because you can only apply :fsharp:`inc` on a value of a :fsharp:`cost` type.

To fix it we modify the function to use :fsharp:`ret` on the result, and we change the type signature to return a :fsharp:`cost` type
(with a cost of 0 since that is the cost :fsharp:`ret` gives):

.. code-block:: fsharp

    val applyOnce (#a #b:Type): (a -> b) -> a -> b `cost` 0
    let applyOnce #_ #_ f x = ret (f x)

Now elaborating the function will yield the following:

.. code-block:: fsharp

    val applyOnce (#a #b:Type): (a -> b) -> a -> b `cost` 0
    let applyOnce #_ #_ f x = inc 2 (ret (f x))

That's because now we have **2 applications**, one of :fsharp:`f` on :fsharp:`x`, and the other of :fsharp:`ret` on the result.

Now the compilation would **still fail** with a typing error:

.. code-block:: none

    Subtyping check failed; expected type Zen.Cost.Realized.cost _ 0; got type Zen.Cost.Realized.cost _ (0 + 2)

That's because while the declared cost is 0, the **inferred** cost (due to the addition of :fsharp:`inc 2`) is 2.

To fix that we now have to declare the **correct** cost within the type, to account for the increment:

.. code-block:: fsharp

    val applyOnce (#a #b:Type): (a -> b) -> a -> b `cost` 2
    let applyOnce #_ #_ f x = inc 2 (ret (f x))

Now that the syntactic cost is accounted for the program will compile.

------

The following function takes a function :fsharp:`f` and an argument :fsharp:`x` and applies :fsharp:`f` on :fsharp:`x` and then on the result:

.. code-block:: fsharp

    val applyTwice (#a:Type): (a -> a) -> a -> a
    let applyTwice #_ f x = f (f x)

Elaborating this function will yield the following:

.. code-block:: fsharp

    val applyTwice (#a:Type): (a -> a) -> a -> a
    let applyTwice #_ f x = inc 2 (f (f x))

The increment by 2 is due to the fact there are 2 applications.

Again - this format won't do, and to be able to compile the elaborated program we have to lift the result into the cost monad and account for the
additional costs:

.. code-block:: fsharp

    val applyTwice (#a:Type): (a -> a) -> a -> a `cost` 3
    let applyTwice #_ f x = ret (f (f x))

which will be elaborated as:

.. code-block:: fsharp

    val applyTwice: #a: Type -> (a -> a) -> a -> cost a 3
    let applyTwice #_ f x = inc 3 (ret (f (f x)))

Notice that this time we've participated the increased elaborated cost in advance, so the original code won't compile (since :fsharp:`ret` gives
a cost of 0) while the elaborated code will (since it will add :fsharp:`inc 3` to account for the costs of all the function applications).

You can declare the correct types either **before** or **after** the elaboration, since the elaboration process **leaves the types intact**, but
in general it's preferred to correct the types **after** the elaboration, because then the original code would still compile and you won't have to
predict the elaborated costs.

-----

Now let's create another function - which takes a boolean :fsharp:`b`, a function :fsharp:`f`, and another argument :fsharp:`x`,
and applies :fsharp:`f` on :fsharp:`x` **once** if :fsharp:`b` is :fsharp:`true` or **twice** if :fsharp:`b` is :fsharp:`false`.

We'll use the previously defined functions to do so:

.. code-block:: fsharp

    val onceOrTwice (#a:Type): bool -> (a -> a) -> a -> a `cost` ?
    let onceOrTwice #_ b f x = if b then applyOnce f x else applyTwice f x

What should be the declared cost of this function?

:fsharp:`applyOnce` gives a cost of **2**, while :fsharp:`applyTwice` gives a cost of **3**, so we have a **collision of costs**.

To reconcile the collision we manually insert :fsharp:`inc 1` to the :fsharp:`applyOnce f x` clasue to account for the difference between the costs,
which would give both clauses of the :fsharp:`if-then-else` the cost of **3**:

.. code-block:: fsharp

    val onceOrTwice (#a:Type): bool -> (a -> a) -> a -> a `cost` 3
    let onceOrTwice #_ b f x = if b then inc 1 (applyOnce f x) else applyTwice f x

However - we still need to account for the syntactic cost of the :fsharp:`onceOrTwice` function itself - to do so we first elaborate the function,
which gives us:

.. code-block:: fsharp

    val onceOrTwice (#a:Type): bool -> (a -> a) -> a -> a `cost` 3
    let onceOrTwice #_ b f x = inc 7 (if b then inc 1 (applyOnce f x) else applyTwice f x)

That is beacuse the :fsharp:`then` clause has **4 applications**, while the :fsharp:`else` clause has **3**, and since the syntactic cost of
an :fsharp:`if-then-else` is defined as **3** + the maximal syntactic cost out of both clauses, which is **4** in this case, we get a total syntactic cost
of **7**, which is embedded with an :fsharp:`inc 7` into the let-expression.

Now to account for the additional cost of **7** we change the declared cost of the function:

.. code-block:: fsharp

    val onceOrTwice (#a:Type): bool -> (a -> a) -> a -> a `cost` 10
    let onceOrTwice #_ b f x = inc 7 (if b then inc 1 (applyOnce f x) else applyTwice f x)
